AC31008 Networks Assignment 2 - IRC Server and Bot

Both server and bot are made with Python 3.

# Server
This server is a basic implementation of the IRC protocol, where multiple users can join the server, join multiple channels, or message one another privately.

# Bot
A simple bot implementing the full IRC protocol that connects to a single channel on a server, where it will respond to user requests for the time or date. Private messaging the bot will result in it sending back a random phrase or sentence.
The bot works with both the server in this repo, and miniircd.
